                        <h1 class="mb-4"><span class="text-primary">Ngorongoro Crater</span> Day Trip</h1>
                         <p class="mb-4">Ngorongoro crater is the biggest /major/ key attraction in the Ngorongoro conservational area, and it is no surprise that it is the reason for the conservation area’s fame. The Ngorongoro Crater is one of Africa’s most iconic sights, with the highest concentration of wild species on the continent. The Crater, sometimes referred to as the “eighth wonder of the world,” has gained international acclaim, attracting an ever-increasing number of visitors each year. You won’t be able to get away from other vehicles here, but you’ll be rewarded with incredible wildlife viewing in a truly breathtaking setting.</p> 
                         <p class= "mb-4">The world’s biggest intact volcanic caldera, the Ngorongoro Crater, is located in Tanzania-Ngorongoro near Serengeti national park. It is home to over 30,000 creatures at any given time. The rim of the crater is about 2,200 meters high and has its own climate. The small outlines of animals making their way around the crater floor far below can be seen from this elevated vantage point. Most days of the year, swaths of clouds hang about the rocky rim, and it’s one of the few spots in Tanzania where it may feel chilly at night.</p> 
                         <p class= "mb-4">The main feature of the Ngorongoro Conservation Authority is the Ngorongoro Crater, the world's largest inactive, intact and unfilled volcanic caldera. The crater, which formed when a large volcano exploded and collapsed on itself two to three million years ago, is 610 metres (2,000 feet) deep and its floor covers 260 square kilometres (100 square miles). Estimates of the height of the original volcano range from 4,500 to 5,800 metres (14,800 to 19,000 feet) high. The crater floor is 1,800 metres (5,900 feet) above sea level. The crater was voted by Seven Natural Wonders as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa in Arusha, Tanzania, in February 2013. The Ngorongoro volcano was active from about 2.45 to 2 million years ago.</p>

                                <h1 class="mb-4">Lake Eyasi<span class="text-primary"> Day Trip</span></h1>
                                 <p class="mb-4">Lake Eyasi is a seasonal shallow endorheic salt lake on the floor of the Great Rift Valley. It is in northern Tanzania, south of the Ngorongoro highlands. You will have plenty of time to enjoy this tranquil environment and to absorb its natural setting. This lake eyasi is above sea level. In contrast to the savannah and arid plains of northern national parks, Lake Eyasi offers tall palm trees along its shores.</p> 
                                 <h2>Wildlife at Lake Eyasi</h2>
                                 <p >Lake Eyasi doesn’t attract big-game wildlife populations as seen in the neighbouring parks and conservation areas, you won’t see the big five here. The lake is a birdwatchers dream due to the many resident species of birds found here. The shallow waters support a huge diversity of breeding waterbirds from June to November. The main attraction are the large populations of flamingos and great white pelicans. Africa spoonbill, Fischer’s lovebird, gray headed gulls, pied avocet, spurfowl, stork, barbet, weaver and many more birds can be found around the shores of Lake Eyasi.</p> 
                                 <p class= "mb-4">Another great sighting are the many hippos at Lake Eyasi. The lake is providing them a place to avoid the hot sun during daytime. They are known to come and cool off in its brackish waters when the lake is full. A number of other wildlife species frequent the springs in the surrounding region.</p>
                                 <h2>Hadzabe Tribe living at Lake Eyasi</h2>
                                <p class= "mb-4">The Hadzabe bushmen live in the region around the lake. They are one of the few remaining tribes that still live the same way like they did hundreds of years ago. A visit with the bushmen is worthwhile! They subsist entirely of the bush and by bow hunting. The Hazabe Bushmen are one of the last remaining hunter-gatherers in Africa and live solely on the land. Just as in the Stone Age, like our ancestors did for thousands of years.</p> 
                                <p class="mb-4">The Hadzabe bushmen live in the region around Lake Eyasi. You can also find the Datoga and Mbulu tribes here. A visit with the bushmen is worthwhile and they will graciously show you where and how they live and hunt. They subsist entirely of the bush and by bow hunting. The Hazabe Bushmen are one of the last remaining hunter-gatherers in Africa and live solely on the land. Just as in the Stone Age, like our ancestors did for thousands of years.</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">Experience the culture, habitat and way of life of the Hadzabe Bushmen first hand on this cultural activity. You go with the Bushman on a hunting trip around Lake Eyasi early in the morning. Learn how they make fire and prepare their food. In the afternoon you will visit a market where Hadzabe trade their honey, fruits and other things for knives, arrows and spears that the Datoga silversmith’s make. This cultural activity is absolutely a memorable experience and worth the extra time</p>

                     <p class="mb-4">Tarangire National Park is a national park in Tanzania's Manyara Region. The name of the park originates from the Tarangire River that crosses the park. The Tarangire River is the primary source of fresh water for wild animals in the Tarangire Ecosystem during the annual dry season. The Tarangire Ecosystem is defined by the long-distance migration of wildebeest and zebras. During the dry season thousands of animals concentrate in Tarangire National Park from the surrounding wet-season dispersal and calving areas.</p> 
                     <p class= "mb-4">It covers an area of approximately 2,850 square kilometers (1,100 square miles.) The landscape is composed of granitic ridges, river valley, and swamps. Vegetation is a mix of Acacia woodland, Combretum woodland, seasonally flooded grassland, and baobab trees. Tarangire National Park can be reached via paved road south from Arusha in under two hours. Lake Manyara National Park is a 70 kilometer (43 mile) drive from Tarangire.</p> 
                     <p class= "mb-4">The park is famous for its high density of elephants and baobab trees. Visitors to the park in the June to November dry season can expect to see large herds of thousands of zebra, wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Other common resident animals include waterbuck, giraffe, dik dik, impala, eland, Grant's gazelle, vervet monkey, banded mongoose, and olive baboon. Predators in Tarangire include lion, leopard, cheetah, caracal, honey badger, and African wild dog.</p>
